 Abstractâ€”Helping others is an excellent way to help ourselves.
It can be done in many ways. We are providing a platform where
one can help people either by donating or by volunteering. Many
people want to organize events that are directly or indirectly
helpful to someone. So, they will be able to organize the event on
our system. For that, they might need donations or volunteers.
After the announcement of any event on our platform, donors and
volunteers will get to know about it. Events can be categorized
according to age, gender, number of participants though it
depends on the event organizer. Sometimes people do not get
to know about such events that are happening to their nearby
areas. So, by using some promotional strategies on social media,
people will also get to know about the event so that they can
participate in it according to the time and location provided by
the event organizer
